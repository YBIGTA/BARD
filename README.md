# BARD - Beyond Author, Recomposing your Day
YBIGTA 2022-2 Conference 1st Place, BARD

## Introduction
Photos capture important moments in people's lives, but over time, the memories associated with them become weathered. To prevent the stories behind these photos from being lost, we aim to reimagine them as storybooks, adding a touch of romance to everyday life.

BARD uses [`BLIP`](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP) alongside [`GPT-3`](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) to generate captions of given image and recompose story based on given characters and captions. Then uses summary of the story to generate illustrated picture of the story with [`DALL-E`](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2)
